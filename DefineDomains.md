Domains are needed to distinguish the various contexts. Domains can be understood as a unique key / id and it is nothing magic or complicated. For example you could have a UserJoinEvent which is triggered when a user joined a game and you want to recognize that in a game list and on a waiting page. In that case you could define a “game-domain” where all events important for the game go to (something like GameStartEvent and UserLeaveEvent, etc.). Now you have the idea to write a conversation plugin for your application. In that case you will also need a UserJoinEvent and UserLeaveEvent, but it shouldn't be handled the same way like in the game context. To re-use the two events (or also the listener if it is factually possible) you can define another domain like "conversation-domain" to avoid conflicts between the same events in different contexts.
