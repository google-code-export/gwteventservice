Here you can find a small tutorial to see how to get started with GWTEventService. Some UML diagrams to understand and get an overview about the API and additional information can be found within the <a href='http://gwteventservice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Manual.pdf'>manual</a>. The get started instructions should help you to define your first domains and to write your first own listener and events. It's a little bit work to define all the classes and to adjust the client and server side classes, but you should get a clean architecture and design. Let's start to think, define and write.
