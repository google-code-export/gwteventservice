You may know listeners and events of different GUI frameworks like Swing or AWT. The client API of GWTEventService works nearly the same way, but with the difference that you are registering the listeners imaginable to the server. That listening method can theoretically resolve all polling calls to the server. You need to think of and define the events which your client side has to know about. For example a conversation application will at least need a UserJoinEvent, UserLeaveEvent and a NewMessageEvent. The events can be simple Beans or POJOs and can theoretically get all serializable values which are available on the server side. The Event interface is only a marker interface and there is logically no default implementation. The domain can't knowingly be got from the Event, because the listener shouldn't be aware of the different domains. If the listener has to differentiate between the different domains, it is a clear signal that you should define different listeners. But when you really need the domain in your events, nothing stops you defining your own abstract event...
