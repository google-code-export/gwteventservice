 * of the server side and has the task to encode / process the transferred events at the client side.
 *
 * The {@link de.novanic.eventservice.client.connection.strategy.connector.streaming.DefaultStreamingClientConnector} is an
 * abstract implementation for streaming listen methods and needs an implementation to deserialize sent events.

 * Streaming means that the connection is hold open for a specified time and when an event
 * occurs, the answer / event is streamed directly to the client without closing and re-open the connection. The connection is
 * closed and re-opened (by the client) when the configured max. waiting time is reached.
